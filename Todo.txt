-section projects to build
-I want to make a smooth transition of projects section height when we click on filters (which removes projects and decrease the height of the section.)
The problem is that the final height is auto. I can't animate from X to auto.

put a isFirstTime in state to not trigger the useEffect the fist time.
use destructuring for object in setFilterState and Good luck Benjamin of tomorrow
